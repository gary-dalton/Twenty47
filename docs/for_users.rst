Purpose
=======
Twenty47 allows simple input of basic dispatch information. This data
is then pushed to email or SMS subscribers. For most users, there are
2 forms available.

The Dispatch Create form

   :alt: Create a new dispatch form

The Subscriber form

   :alt: Manage your subscription form
   
The use of both these forms should be self-explanatory. Upon submission,
Dispatch Create sends a notification to all subscribers. The effects of 
Subscriber form require more explanation.

Effects of Subscriber form

All subscribers must be approved before they are allowed to receive
notifications.
